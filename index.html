        <h1> Our project:</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Arial"> We plan to make a platformer with obstacles and enemies. The player will fight enemies using a turn based combat system. 
            At the end of each level the player will have to face a different negative emotion such as fear, hate, and loss. There will be a specific strategy or gimmick to defeat each of them. 
            At the very end, the player will face the final boss, which is the embodiment of all the player's negative attributes. 
            The player will have to beat them by accepting them, and in doing so, accepting themselves for who they are.</p>
    
        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p style="font-family: silkscreen"> "You wake up inside a strange world, soon coming to find out you're inside your own mind. You decide to start walking. To where, you don't know. Along the way, you come face to face with different aspects of yourself and negative emotions, overcoming them all one by one. However, your true enemy all along is someone you could never expect: yourself."
